# aws_s3 `fastlane` Plugin

[![fastlane Plugin Badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/fastlane/fastlane/master/fastlane/assets/plugin-badge.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-aws_s3)

## Getting Started

This project is a [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with fastlane-plugin-s3, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin aws_s3
```

## About aws_s3

Upload a new build to Amazon S3 to distribute the build to beta testers. Works for both Ad Hoc and Enterprise signed applications. This step will generate the necessary HTML, plist, and version files for you.

The `aws_s3` action can upload both iOS apps (IPAs) and Android apps (APKs). If you would like to upload both iOS and Android apps to the same bucket, you can set the `app_directory` parameter so each app goes into their own S3 bucket directory.

Below is what the default generated page looks like that gets hosted on S3.

## Example

Add the `aws_s3` action after the `gym` step:

```ruby
aws_s3
```

You can also customize a lot of options:
```ruby
aws_s3(
  # All of these are used to make Shenzhen's `ipa distribute:s3` command
  access_key: ENV['S3_ACCESS_KEY'],               # Required from user.
  secret_access_key: ENV['S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'], # Required from user.
  bucket: ENV['S3_BUCKET'],                       # Required from user.
  region: ENV['S3_REGION'],                       # Required from user.

  expires_in: 3600,                               # Optional. If set, presigned URLs will be generated which expire after this time (seconds).

  ipa: 'AppName.ipa',                             # Required (if not uploading an APK).
  dsym: 'AppName.app.dSYM.zip',                   # Optional is you use `ipa` to build.

  apk: 'AppName.apk',                             # Required (if not uploading an IPA).

  app_directory: 'ios_or_android',                # Optional but nice if you want to put multiple apps in same bucket

  path: 'v{CFBundleShortVersionString}_b{CFBundleVersion}/', # This is actually the default.
  upload_metadata: true,                          # Upload version.json, plist and HTML. Set to false to skip uploading of these files.
  version_file_name: 'app_version.json',          # Name of the file to upload to S3. Defaults to 'version.json'
  version_template_path: 'path/to/erb'            # Path to an ERB to configure the structure of the version JSON file
)
```

It is recommended to **not** store the AWS access keys in the `Fastfile`.

The uploaded `version.json` file provides an easy way for apps to poll if a new update is available. The JSON looks like:

```json
{
    "latestVersion": "<%= full_version %>",
    "updateUrl": "itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=<%= url %>"
}
```
